The Code represents a simple Spring Boot application for managing customer
records with a single Customer entity, a CustomerRepository, and a Main class that serves as
the entry point for the application.

=>Customer Class:
  The Customer class is well-structured as a JPA entity with proper annotations for database persistence.
  It includes fields for id, name, email, and age, and has constructors, getters,
  setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods

 => CustomerRepository Interface:
     The CustomerRepository interface extends JpaRepository, providing CRUD operations for the Customer entity.

 =>  Main Class:
      The Main class serves as the entry point for the Spring Boot application.
      It's annotated with @SpringBootApplication, indicating that it's the main application class.
      The @RestController and @RequestMapping annotations define an API for customer management
      under the /api/v1/customers endpoint.

 RECOMMENDATIONS

 1. Separation of Concern:
     it's a good practice to separate concerns. Consider creating a separate CustomerController class for
      handling HTTP requests and a CustomerService class for encapsulating the business
      logic related to customers.

 2. At the Customer Class, consider using Lombok to avoid boiler plate code.

 3. Validation:
     Consider Implementing  input validation for request data. Ensure that the incoming data is valid and
     conforms to expected formats. You can use validation annotations or custom validation logic,
     especially for the email field.

  4. Exception Handling:
      Consider Implementing proper exception handling in your endpoints.
      When a customer is not found during an update or delete operation,
      return an HTTP 404 status code with a meaningful error message.

  5.Response Data:
     Consider returning more informative responses. For example, when a new customer is created, you could
      return a success message or other customer's information like the email, name.

  6. Code Cleanup:
    Consider removing any commented-out code blocks and unused or redundant code to maintain a clean codebase.

  7. Testing:
       Write unit tests and integration tests for your API endpoints to ensure they work as expected.

     You can also Implement logging in your application to help with debugging and monitoring. Log important events and
     error messages for easier troubleshooting.

  8. Pagination and Sorting:
       If the list of customers grows, consider adding pagination and sorting capabilities to the
       getCustomers method to improve performance and usability.

  9. In the database configuration, During development and testing phases, using create-drop is fine, but please
       In production environments, it's generally better to use update as it allows your application to apply schema
       changes incrementally without disrupting existing data.
